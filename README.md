# üìö Daily Research Log

An open-access repository dedicated to documenting my daily research, technical findings, and learning journey. Every entry is captured as a standalone **HTML file** for simple access and review.

This project serves as a personal knowledge base and a public log of my continuous development and curiosity.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The files are typically organized by date or topic for easy navigation.

| File/Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[Date]/[Topic].html` | Individual HTML files containing the research notes. |
| `assets/` | Contains images, stylesheets, or scripts referenced by the HTML pages. |
| `README.md` | You are reading it! |

## ‚ú® Getting Started

Since this repository contains static HTML files, you can view the research entries directly through any web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/adithp/daily-research.git](https://github.com/adithp/daily-research.git)
    ```
2.  **Browse the files:** Open any `.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., double-click it in your file explorer).

## üí° How I Use It

Whenever I research a new topic, solve a complex bug, or discover a useful code snippet, I create a new HTML page detailing:
* The **Problem** or **Topic**.
* The **Solution** or **Key Takeaways**.
* **Code Examples** (if applicable).
* **Source Links**.
